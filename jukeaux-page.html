<b>Introduction</b><br><br>
During quarantine, I spent a lot of time listening to music. Living without roommates I had the luxury of playing my music out loud whenever I felt like it, which ended up being almost all the time. I made and went through playlists at a record speed: one to wake up in the morning and one to send me to bed, one for Jazz music to study and one for pop music to go on runs. Even one specifically for drives down the Pacific Coast Highway. I ran into a problem I hadn’t faced since high school when I had an hour-long commute to school every morning. <br><br>
But, finding music through friends happens incidentally which takes a long time<br><br>
<b>First, I asked friends how they typically discover music</b><br>
<p class="user-quotes"> “I find music mostly through friends or using Shazam, but the number one way is definitely through friends” - Abby, USC Junior </p>
<p class="user-quotes"> “I mainly find music using Shazam or through my friends. My friends will be playing a song, and I ask what song it is then stalk their playlist.”- Andrew, Northwestern Freshman</p>
<p class="user-quotes"> "I hate that it takes a long time to find music because I have to listen to the whole song. Sometimes I try to allot time just to adding new music, but that’s really hard so I try to add songs to a playlist as I hear them and like them.” - Camila <br><br>
</p>
<p class="body-text"> <b>Insights:</b><br><br>
    Music discovery is social: young people like to find music through their friends through stalking their Spotify playlists or Shazaming their songs<br><br>
    Because of the vulnerability involved in sharing music, although young people find music through friends, their friends don’t actively share music with them. They save their friends’ songs through anonymous back channels, such as Shazam or by stalking friends’ Spotify accounts. <br><br>
    <b>Since people seemed to find music predominantly through friends, I asked them about the other side of the process: sharing music with friends</b><br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="user-quotes"> “People are kind of embarrassed by sharing their music. Something I’ve noticed is people have surface level music to seem cool, but not music that’s basic, music that makes them seem unique and then they have separate music they actually like.” - Fouad, University of Washington sophomore </p>
<p class="user-quotes">"I take pride in auxing but I sometimes get nervous about playing music people don’t like. If it’s close friends I don’t care as much, but it depends who’s there. I’ll cater to specific people. Instead of making a playlist for a night, I’ll make a queue because I don’t need that group of songs permanently, it’s just for one night.” - Eli, Northwestern junior</p><br>
<p class="body-text"> <b>Insights:</b><br><br>
    Sharing music is vulnerable because people feel pressure to play songs that others will like<br><br>

<p class="body-text"><b>Problem Statement: How can we more efficiently connect people to their friends' music libraries without judgement </b><br>
<br>The Solution: JukeAux <br><br>
JukeAux is an app that allows friends to capitalize on time together as opportunities to share music without judgement. JukeAux allows everyone in a group to have a say in the music experience of a gathering by having the ability to nominate songs to a queue and to “star” their favorite nominations to bump them higher in the queue. <br><br>
Whether you’re cooking dinner with your three housemates or hanging out at a 30-person party, you can join your group’s location-based room and add songs to the queue, as well as “star” songs others have added to bump it up in the queue. When the queue is over, every user is sent a playlist with all of the songs that played in the queue so they can save the songs they loved to their own libraries. <br><br>
