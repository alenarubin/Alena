    In September of 2020, I competed in Northwestern’s Designathon, where my team and I designed a product to answer the question “How can we foster community during the remote learning period at Northwestern?” 
    <br><br>
After discussing our personal pain points with remote learning and talking to peers, we decided that we would focus primarily on fostering community in the academic aspect of college. We felt that a social 
platform presented to students by the school would be unappealing, but a way to connect through class and schoolwork would be more appetizing and could lend itself naturally to further connections and relationships.
<br><br>

Initial Research: 
We had access to a campus-wide survey about remote learning from Spring quarter of 2020. Many respondents cited difficulty getting help from classmates through virtual learning, and having lower motivation as a result. 
42% of responses related to lower motivation in class due to difficulty working with peers: “I do not have my peers to help support and motivate me academically” 
<br><br>
Insight: it’s difficult to meet “class friends” that you would normally connect with by sitting next to one another or seeing each other physically in class. Students felt isolated and alone in their classes, and didn’t know how to connect with their classmates.
<br><br>
Which led us to the problem we decided to design for:
How Can We: create a virtual open door policy among students that promotes collaborative learning?
<br><br>
Our Solution: OpenDoor, an online platform to connect with other students in your classes
<br><br>
Main Features:
<br>
An open door to a virtual study room where students can get homework and study help in real time
<br>
    Available 24/7<br>
    Video and audio chat <br>
    A text-based “group chat” with the whole class where students can ask and answer questions, share quizlets, etc.<br>
    Options to join study groups to create smaller communities within a larger class<br>
        “Green group” for beginner coders<br>
        European time zones study group<br>
        Thursdays @ 4 CST study group<br>
